[KEYWORDS]:
PowerShell Automation
Bootable Media Creation
Console Application / CLI
UEFI/BIOS Support with Removable Media

[CURATED TO]:
Operating System - Microsoft Windows (MAY NOT WORK WITH VERSIONS WHERE POWERSHELL IS NOT INSTALLED. IF NOT, MANUALLY INSTALL POWERSHELL BEFOREHAND.)
Removable Media - CDROM and Optical Discs (CD, DVD, BLU-RAY, USB, et cetera)
Optical disc images - ISO or other format

[KNOWN ISSUES]:
Removable Media support on older OSes - On legacy systems (such as below Vista), preparing a USB can be more difficult. However, an optical disc (CD/DVD) is recommended for versions below Build 6000 (Windows Vista SP0, Build 6000, NT 6.0)

[USE OF OTHER WORK]:
Yes, the script uses the Rufus UEFI:NTFS drivers. They are re-formatted from the Rufus "uefi-ntfs.img" FAT12, but reformatted to an ISO image for compatibility.

[PLATFORM]:
The original software is distributed in this very repository, on GitHub.
